; Both curl http+https://scoulomb.github.io -> 301 to coulombel.it in https with https enforcement or not activated,
; All page after 2016 for io domaire are https -> cf https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https )

; -- REDIRECTION --

; sylvain.coulombel.it
; It is ok to define
; sylvain 300 IN CNAME coulombel.it. (use . instead of coulombel.it does not work at least here as extremity)
; or point to scoulomb.github.io. cf consequences in appendix-github-page-and-dns.md
; => But this will not work at github routing level. We need to use redirection (remember www was the only exception, see www.coulombel.it)
; Thus:
; - 1. A DOUBLE redirection is defined https://sylvain.coulombel.it + http://sylvain.coulombel.it PERMANENT https://scoulomb.github.io
; So that we can use https or http in inbound we have a double indirection
; In outbound I could point to both http or https (as github redirect http to https for io domain)
; - 2. Note this CNAME RECORD IS GENERATED when creating a redirection (and removed when deleting it)
; And when using http+https, the CNAME is different than http alone,
; for http alone it is webredir.vip.gandi.net. whereas for http+https it is webredir.gandi.net.
; When doing a modify to change http to http+https we may miss this change
; Indeed Gandi does not regenerate the record and keep webredir.gandi.net. (I tested it)
; Thus all https links are broken as using  webredir.vip.gandi.net. (http)
; To find this root cause create a http and http+https redirection and check generated records
; - 3. Finally a certificate is generated. Note that when generation is not completed both http and https (it may work for http if pointing to bad CNAME webredir.vip.gandi.net.)
; So all redirection are using let's encrypt

; But for https://www.coulombel.it we have potential security risk ahead because certificate is not valid for www.coulombel.it
; To provide a certificate, I will use redirection

www 300 IN CNAME webredir.gandi.net.
; resolution details are given in example of resolution: www.coulombel.it case which includes redirection

; If need to recreate from scratch (see -1,-2,-3) I propose to create redirection here and overrwrite DNS config with this file
